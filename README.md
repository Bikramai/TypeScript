# TypeScript

# Introduction

A programming language to address shortcomings of JavaScript. We can think brother and sister of JavaScript. JavaScript is kids like without any discipline  who does whatever he or she wants. Typscript in otherhand like kids with discipline. 

Technically, specking Typescript is programming language built on top of JavaScript. So, every JavaScript file is a valid Typescript file.

Benefits of Typescript or some of the features of Typescript that help us to build robust and maintainable application in less time.

- Static typing
    - We have two type of programming languages Statically-Typed (C++, C#, Java) and Dynamically-Typed(JavaScript, Python, Ruby)
- Code completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notations

TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with Type Checking. With TypeScript we explicitly set the type of a variable upon decoration just like how we code statically type languages then we pass our code into compilier and the compiler will tell us if we are doing something wrong so we can catch our a lot of mistakes as compile time. We can use where in frontend or backend.

Drawbacks of TypeScript:

- Compilation
  .ts ———> Compiler ———> .js
       Transpiration
    
- Discipline in Coding
    TypeScript ——> Medium to large projects
    JavaScript ———> Simple projects
