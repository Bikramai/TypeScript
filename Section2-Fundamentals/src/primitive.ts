/* 
In TypeScript, if we have a large number, we can separate these digits using an underscore.
In TypeScript, we don't always have to annotate our variables, because the typescript 
compiler can infer or detect the type of our variable based on a value. We don't have to annotate.
so let remove the annotation from each variables.

For example, because we have initialized this variables to a number, string, boolean. 
TypeScript compiler knows that these variables. So, we don't have to annotate it. 
If we remove the annotation, and hover our mouse over these variables look, we can
see that sales is number, course is string, and is_publish is boolean.
